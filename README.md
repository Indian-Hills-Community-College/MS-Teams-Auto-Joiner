## This python script will automatically join [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) meetings appearing in your [Teams calendar](https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/calendarv2).

## Features:
- This python script will automatically open a chrome tab, enter your username, your password, open the calendar tab and then join a meeting if available.
- Before joining any meeting, it will by default turn off your camera and microphone.
- After the organiser ends the meeting, it will open the calendar tab to look for new meetings and join the next meeting if available.
- If the organiser leaves the meet instead of ending the meet, the script will automatically leave the meeting after the number of attendees falls below the minimum participants allowed set by the user (default is 10), but will rejoin the meeting if the join button is still visible on the calendar tab.

## Requirements:
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Google Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome/)

## Prerequisites:
### After cloning the repo, go in the repo directory and then follow below steps:
- Step 1:
    Install dependencies from [requirements.txt](requirements.txt):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- Extra config:
    - To run in headless mode:
        Set `headless` to `true`.
## Usage:
-   Run [autoJoin.py](autoJoin.py):
    ```bash
    python autoJoin.py
    ```
- The script might not work as expected if the browser is minimised i.e you may open other windows above it but do not minimize the chrome window.

## Sample Scenario:
- You have a meeting at 9 A.M, you may run the script anytime before 9 A.M. and the script will automatically join the meeting when the join button is available.
- The script will then automatically join the next meeting scheduled at e.g.:- 10 A.M. AFTER the organiser ends the meeting.
- If the organiser does not end the meeting i.e the organiser leaves the meeting instead of ending the meeting, the script will leave the meeting after the strength of the meeting falls down to 10 or any minimum value set by the user.
- To set a custom condition to automatically leave the meeting change the code on line# 140 of [autoJoin.py](autoJoin.py)
